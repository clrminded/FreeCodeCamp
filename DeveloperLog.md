# Developer Log

## 6/21/2022
Had the final exam on software engineering, probably most frustrating was being caught off guard having to pull up a maven project as well as get the tests to pass on TravisCI. Other than that some basic inheritance java questions. 
Also been going back and forth on continuing with iOS development, as much as I want to, I just dont think Ill have the time to with all the other projects that I got going on. Since I havent really touched javascript in a few years, just going to start from the beginning, but already coming up with ideas for the portfolio project.
Finished the cap photos app and the menu app on freecodecamp.

Finished the coffee menu app, and the colored markers app, started on the registration form. Started thinking about how to put together the cerification projects. In the past when trying to finish these projects, I never really made it past the product page. It would be nice to get passed them this. Getting these certification badges might be the first step to actually getting a job. 
On the other side I was working on some C++, trying to get the GLFW libraries working inside Visual Studio. Other then that, I do have to finish my math final. The last time I did the documentation pages I did the documents on Objective-C, this time I might do it on R or C++, since I do already have a bunch of information on it.
I did get the math final done, score 81% on it, totally happy with the results. So just one more to go. I also started going through the javascript section on freecodecamp. Blew through the ES6 section. Which over all the years that I have tried going through that I do seem to make progress. Since the ES6 syntax is pretty standard now, gotta get in the game. Anyways time for sleep...

Trying to come back in after a year and see where I was at and how much better I can make things.
