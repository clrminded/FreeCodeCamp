# Developer Log

## 6/21/2022
Had the final exam on software engineering, probably most frustrating was being caught off guard having to pull up a maven project as well as get the tests to pass on TravisCI. Other than that some basic inheritance java questions. 
Also been going back and forth on continuing with iOS development, as much as I want to, I just dont think Ill have the time to with all the other projects that I got going on. Since I havent really touched javascript in a few years, just going to start from the beginning, but already coming up with ideas for the portfolio project.
Finished the cap photos app and the menu app on freecodecamp.
